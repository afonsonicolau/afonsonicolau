### Hello dear user!

My name is __Afonso Nicolau__ and I am currently a DevOps Intern @ xgeeks. I have big expectations, ambitions, defined objectives and a goal to achieve.

I want to improve and learn as much as I can, as well as innovate with new techonology and software.
Talking about tech and supporting others into making them programming, showing them how __important__ it is to improve in this world of everyday changes and evolution, is really one of the things I feel absolutely happy to have a conversation about.
